Based on Jerome's feedback, let's sketch out a plan to enhance the CareerCompass Pro application with subscription features, resume generation, and cover letter capabilities. First, I'll outline the necessary changes to transform this into a subscription-based service.

Implementation Plan
To fully implement this subscription-based career tool service, here's what we need to do:

Authentication System:

Replace the mock authentication with a proper database (Firebase, Supabase, etc.)
Add proper password hashing for security
Implement session management
Payment Processing:

Integrate with Stripe or another payment processor
Set up webhook endpoints for subscription status updates
Implement proper receipt generation
Multi-page Navigation:

Refine the page navigation system
Add proper styling for the dashboard and tool pages
Implement persistent storage of user content
Enhanced Resume Generation:

Improve the resume generation prompts to be more format-aware
Add multiple resume styles/templates
Include industry-specific optimizations
Cover Letter Generator:

Create a robust company research component
Add multiple cover letter styles/templates
Include industry-specific versions
User Experience:

Add progress tracking for job applications
Create a saved documents section
Implement email notifications for subscription renewal
This implementation addresses Jerome's suggestions by:

Creating a subscription system with bi-weekly, monthly, and annual options
Adding resume generation capabilities to create better resumes
Adding cover letter generation based on the user's resume and company background
Focusing on solving the user pain point of customizing resumes and cover letters for each job application
